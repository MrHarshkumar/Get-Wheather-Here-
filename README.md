# Get-Wheather-Here-
This is a project that can be used to find the wheather of the different city.
In this project we just used HTML CSS bootstrap and javascript.
Here we used HTML , CSS and Bootstrap to make the user interface and then we 
used JS to all the functionality.
Here the main work of the JS is to fetch the data using the API of the wheather and then we extract the desired 
data from the fetched value and it fetch the data as per the input 
and then we display it to the user. 
Index.html is for the user interface and Use.HTML is about the "How to use"
and script.js is for the writing the functionality and all the js code.
transform.txt is file that i made it for my use and nothing else 
its not helping the project anyway and index.zip is zip file and nothing else.
