# Get-Wheather-Here-
This is a project that can be used to find the wheather of the different city.
In this project we just used HTML CSS bootstrap and javascript.
Here we used HTML , CSS and Bootstrap to make the user interface and then we 
used JS to all the functionality.
Here the main work of the JS is to fetch the data using the API of the wheather and then we extract the desired 
data from the fetched value and it fetch the data as per the input 
and then we display it to the user.
